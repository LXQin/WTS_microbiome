Methods: FASTQ File Preprocessing and Alignment

We used Samtools v1.6, Bowtie2 v2.5.4, GCC 12.3.0, Bedtools v2.31.1, Trim Galore v0.6.10, Bracken v2.9, Kraken v2.1.3 and CHM13 v2.0 for processing paired-end FASTQ files. 
First, Trim Galore was applied to remove low-quality bases and adapter sequences from paired-end reads. 
Trimmed reads were aligned to the hg38 reference genome using BWA-MEM, with unmapped reads extracted using Samtools flags -f 4 (unmapped reads) and -f 8 (properly paired unmapped reads). 
Mitochondrial reads (chrM) were excluded from the BAM files to focus on bacteria, and further unmapped reads were saved for downstream analysis. 
The remaining unmapped reads were re-aligned to the CHM13 reference genome with Bowtie2, and any further unmapped reads were extracted. 
These unmapped reads were classified using Kraken2 against 16GB and 8GB databases to identify non-human sequences. 
Classification results were refined with Bracken, using the -l G parameter to estimate species abundance at the genus level and -t 1 to set the threshold for read count filtering.
Key parameters, such as threading options (-p for Bowtie2 and -t for BWA-MEM), were set to 8 to optimize computational efficiency. 
The pipeline effectively processes the reads to identify microbial sequences, excluding human nuclear and mitochondrial genes.

We filtered 143 samples in our initial analysis, yet only obtained the mapped results of 107 samples due to memory limitation. Among these 107 samples, hg38 identified an average of 99.78% reads mapped to the human genome and CHM13 extracted an additional 10.23% reads of the human genome on average.
